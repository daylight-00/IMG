Today, the demand for organ transplantation is increasing worldwide, but due to the limited number of donor organs, many efforts are being made.
Among them, xenotransplantation is currently being proposed as the most realistic alternative, and the biggest problem with xenotransplantation is the immune response.

On the other hand, immunogenicity prediction using deep learning technology is currently being actively studied, but there has been no research on immunogenicity in xenotransplantation.
Therefore, in our study, we aim to identify protein structures that can cause immunogenicity during xenotransplantation based on the latest structure-based deep learning technology.
